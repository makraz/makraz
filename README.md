### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer that is fascinated by computer science, Cybersecurity and the ocean of the web, I went through the marvels of this breathtaking digital world with a lot of opportunities to be part of many creative projects & start-ups and worked on many exciting projects that shaped my knowledge and gave meaning to my academic and professional achievements.

The experiences, experiments and challenges that I went through during my high-education journey gave me a clear vision on what I know, what I want and most importantly about what motivates me the most.

Creative, Methodical and thirsty-to-learn engineer that focuses on problem-solving and thinking out-of-the-box which ultimately makes me interested in the changes that happen every day in the IT-sector and proposing solutions to them-unsolved problems, or thinking of improvements of the already-made solutions.
